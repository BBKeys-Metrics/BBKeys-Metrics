 * Summary:
 *   My Scores shows the logged-in employee’s personal 
 *   statistics.  This is the functioning ‘home’ page, as 
 *   it is the default page that appears after login has 
 *   been completed.  The user stats page will show the 
 *   employee’s name and picture, along with their scores 
 *   on various metrics.  The overall employee rating will 
 *   also be listed.  The user can view their averages for 
 *   the last day, week, month, six months, and year, as 
 *   far as such data is available.
